"""Turn per-asset hazard into a ranked, explained priority list.

``score = P(outage) * criticality / 5``. Probability comes from the calibrated outage model; criticality encodes the
consequence of losing that kind of asset. Ties (common for weak storms, where outage risk is ~0 everywhere) are broken
by gale exposure (share of ensemble members bringing 34 kt wind, times criticality), then population. Every rank
carries the plain-language reasons behind it.
